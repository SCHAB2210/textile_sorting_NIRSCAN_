# README

This folder contains test scripts that were evaluated but did not make it to the main folder. These scripts are part of the development process for the textile sorting project using NIRSCAN technology. They serve as a reference for experiments and tests conducted during the project.

Please note that these scripts may not be fully functional or optimized.
